# SemEval-2020 Task 7: Assessing Humor in Edited News Headlines

A Submission by Vinh Ngu and Finn Rietz.


  
## Abstract
In this repository we present our results and methodology in the context of a Competition *SemEval-2020 Task 7: Assessing Humor in Edited News Headlines*. In total, we have developed three different approaches based on different assumptions and interpretations of the provided data set. The implementation is based on the frameworks **keras** and **nltk**. We achieved an accuracy of *24%*. Given the fact that there are 31 possibilities and thus an expected value of *3%*, we have achieved a *seven times greater* accuracy than blind guessing.
